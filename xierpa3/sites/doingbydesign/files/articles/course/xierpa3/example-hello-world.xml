This example instruction shows coding of the most simple website in Xierpa3: Hello world. Stay close for our first walk-through.</lead>

<image src="//data.xierpa.com.s3.amazonaws.com/xierpa3/_images/documentation/helloworldsafari.png"
	alt="Hello world in safari"/>

<p>Open a new Python code document, in an editor suitable for programming, such as  
BBEdit, TextWrangler, Coda, or any other applications that understands Python syntax.
Add this first line to the document, to indicate that it may contain UTF-8 (Unicode) strings.</p>

<image src="//data.xierpa.com.s3.amazonaws.com/xierpa3/_images/documentation/helloworld.py.png"
	alt="Hello world source"/>
<p>Then we will define the Xierpa3 component and builder classes that we need in our website page.</p>
<code>
from xierpa3.components import Theme, Page, Column 
from xierpa3.builders.cssbuilder import CssBuilder
from xierpa3.builders.htmlbuilder import HtmlBuilder
</code>
<p>From the set of available Xierpa3 components, the <b>Theme</b> is used, as site container for the single <b>Page</b>.
On the page there will be one <b>Column.</b></p>
<p>Next is to define the type of column we want to have, holding the simple “Hello world” text. 
We create a new type of component for this behavior, which initially inherits all aspect from the standard
<b>Column</b> class.
</p>
<code>class HelloWorldText(Column):
    def buildBlock(self, b):
        b.div(color='red')
        b.text('Hello world.')
        b._div()
</code>
<p>The <b>b.div</b> instructs the HTML builder to build an HTML open <b>div</b> tag,
where the <b>b.div</b> creates a closing tag. The CSS builder generates the 
corresponding CSS codes for this div, taking the color attribute as value. This attribute
is ignored by the HTML builder. Builders know which attributes are for them.</p>
<p>Now we defined our new type of component, we need a page to place it on.
	Create a new type of theme, that initially inherits all behavior from the main Xierpa3
	<b>Theme</b> component. <b>TITLE</b> defines the specific page name for this type
	of theme, that will appear on the top of the browser window.</p><code>
class HelloWorld(Theme):
    TITLE = u'The standard “Hello world” page.'
</code>
<p>Then one of the required methods is defined for a <b>Theme</b>, answering the
list of <b>Page</b> instances, each filled with their set of components. In this
case there only a one home page, which contains one element: the instance of
<b>HelloWorldText</b>.</p>
<code>
    def baseComponents(self):
        hw = HelloWorldText()
        homePage = Page(components=(hw,), title=self.TITLE)
        return [homePage]
</code>
<p>Calling the <b>self.make()</b> method will build the CSS and HTML and place 
the result in a directory on the users’ desktop. This <b>index.html</b> can be 
dragged on a browser to view. The CSS is saved in a local <b>css</b> directory.
</p>
<code>
    def make(self):
        cssBuilder = CssBuilder()
        cssBuilder.save(self) 
    
        htmlBuilder = HtmlBuilder()
        return htmlBuilder.save(self)  
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    HelloWorld().make()
</code>
<h2>HelloWorldLayout Example</h2>
    <p>In the next example, we’ll add some more styling and layout to the page.
    	Again we import the required classes from Xierpa.</p>
    	<image src="//data.xierpa.com.s3.amazonaws.com/xierpa3/_images/documentation/helloworldlayout.py.png"
    	 alt="Hello world layout"/>
    	<code>
from xierpa3.components import Theme, Page, Column 
from xierpa3.builders.cssbuilder import CssBuilder
from xierpa3.builders.htmlbuilder import HtmlBuilder
from xierpa3.constants.constants import C
from xierpa3.attributes import Em, Margin 
</code>
<p>And again we create a new component, that inherits all behavior from the
	existing <b>Column</b> class. The <b>C</b> class contains a number of constants 
	that can be used throughout the code, to make sure that there is not misspelling
	in names and types. The use of attribute instances such as <b>Em</b> and 
		<b>Margin</b> in the example shows the principle of storing knowsledge
		into attribute instances. <b>Shadow</b> and <b>Gradient</b> (shown in 
		other example site) are also attributes that hide complex HTML and CSS
		from the development level of the user.</p>
	<code>
class HelloWorldText(Column):
    def buildBlock(self, b):
        b.div(class_='column', color='yellow', 
		      margin=Margin(0, C.AUTO, 0, C.AUTO), 
              width='70%', maxwidth=700, minwidth=300, 
		      backgroundcolor='#222', padding=Em(0.5), 
		      fontfamily='Georgia', fontsize=Em(4), 
		      textalign=C.CENTER, lineheight=Em(1.4))
        b.text('Hello world.')
        b._div()
        b.div(class_='caption', color='#888', 
		      margin=Margin(0, C.AUTO, 0, C.AUTO), 
              width='70%', maxwidth=700, minwidth=300,
              paddingleft=Em(0.5), 
		      fontfamily='Georgia', fontsize=Em(0.8), 
		      textalign=C.CENTER, lineheight=Em(1.4), 
		      fontstyle=C.ITALIC)
        b.text('Generated by Xierpa3.')
        b._div()
        </code>
        <p>Note that although the <b>div</b> may suggest that it is just
        HTML building there, the method get called both with <b>b</b> as CssBuilder
        and as HtmlBuilder. Each builder will filter out the appropriate attributes and
        translates it into its own syntax. The HTML tags generated by the article
        are set in CSS by the empty statements.</p>
        <p>Building the styled 2 text blocks, written out with duplicated values,
        as example how this works. See other examples for approaches with more
        cascading styled hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Also note that for clarity of the example, the two <b>div</b> blocks have their own
        (redundant) styling. In a real site application these values would come from the 
        same source, defining their relation in Python code. Also these values will be translated
        into SASS variables, which can be altered there, if the generated files are to be
        used again for manual manipulation, such as external templates.
        The rest of this example is the identical to the simple HelloWorld.</p>
        <code>
class HelloWorldLayout(Theme):
    TITLE = u'The standard “Hello world” page.'

    def baseComponents(self):
        hw = HelloWorldText()
        homePage = Page(components=(hw,), title=self.TITLE)
        return [homePage]

    def make(self):
        cssBuilder = CssBuilder()
        cssBuilder.save(self) 

        htmlBuilder = HtmlBuilder()
        return htmlBuilder.save(self)  
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    HelloWorldLayout().make()
