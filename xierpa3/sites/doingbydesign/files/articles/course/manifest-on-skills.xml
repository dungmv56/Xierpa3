<lead>In a world where only a handful of people seem to have 
    the knowledge and skills to perform a certain task, it hard for fresh students
    to aqcuire these skills. Except for a few, who already do it and would have
    done it anyhow. Not because of their education, but despite their education.
    For all other fresh students this gap is increasing by the day. Not only
    it is hard to motivation, it is also a challenge to maintain it for a number
    of years, before skill and experience are on a level to compete witht the
    happy few, those who already got it. Becasue they were fast learners
    or because they were lucky enough to be raised in an evironment that
    supported their ambitions.</lead>
