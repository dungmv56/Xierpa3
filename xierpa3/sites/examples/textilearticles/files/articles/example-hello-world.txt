h1. Coding the Hello Worlds

p(lead). This example instruction shows coding of the most simple website in Xierpa3: Hello world. Join for our first walk-through.

!(autoWidth)//data.xierpa.com.s3.amazonaws.com/xierpa3/_images/documentation/helloworldsafari.png!

p(first). Open a new Python code document, in an editor suitable for programming, such as   "BBEdit"://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/, "TextWrangler":http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/, "Coda":https://panic.com/coda/, or any other applications that understands Python syntax. Add this first line to the document, to indicate that it may contain UTF-8 (Unicode) strings.

!(autoWidth)//data.xierpa.com.s3.amazonaws.com/xierpa3/_images/documentation/helloworld.py.png!

p(first). Then we will define the Xierpa3 component and builder classes that we need in our website page.

<pre>
from xierpa3.components import Theme, Page, Column 
from xierpa3.builders.cssbuilder import CssBuilder
from xierpa3.builders.htmlbuilder import HtmlBuilder
</pre>

p(first). From the set of available Xierpa3 components, the *Theme* is used, as site container for the single *Page*. On the page there will be one *Column*.

Next is to define the type of column we want to have, holding the simple “Hello world” text. We create a new type of component for this behavior, which initially inherits all aspect from the standard *Column* class.

<pre>class HelloWorldText(Column):
  def buildBlock(self, b):
    b.div(color='red')
    b.text('Hello world.')
    b._div()
</pre>

p(first). The @b.div@ instructs the HTML builder to build an HTML open @div@ tag, where the @b.div@ creates a closing tag. The CSS builder generates the  corresponding CSS codes for this div, taking the color attribute as value. This attribute is ignored by the HTML builder. Builders know which attributes are for them. Now we defined our new type of component, we need a page to place it on. Create a new type of theme, that initially inherits all behavior from the main Xierpa3 *Theme* component. *TITLE* defines the specific page name for this type of theme, that will appear on the top of the browser window.

<pre>class HelloWorld(Theme):
  TITLE = u'The standard “Hello world” page.'
</pre>

p(first). Then one of the required methods is defined for a *Theme*, answering the list of *Page* instances, each filled with their set of components. In this case there only a one home page, which contains one element: the instance of *HelloWorldText*.

<pre>def baseComponents(self):
  hw = HelloWorldText()
  homePage = Page(components=(hw,), title=self.TITLE)
  return [homePage]
</pre>

p(first). Calling the @self.make()@ method will build the CSS and HTML and place the result in a directory on the users’ desktop. This *index.html* can be dragged on a browser to view. The CSS is saved in a local *css* directory.

<pre>def make(self):
  cssBuilder = CssBuilder()
  cssBuilder.save(self) 
  
  htmlBuilder = HtmlBuilder()
  return htmlBuilder.save(self)  
  
if __name__ == '__main__':
  HelloWorld().make()</pre>

h2. HelloWorldLayout Example

p(first). In the next example, we’ll add some more styling and layout to the page. Again we import the required classes from Xierpa.

!(autoWidth)//data.xierpa.com.s3.amazonaws.com/xierpa3/_images/documentation/helloworldlayout.py.png!

<pre>
from xierpa3.components import Theme, Page, Column 
from xierpa3.builders.cssbuilder import CssBuilder
from xierpa3.builders.htmlbuilder import HtmlBuilder
from xierpa3.constants.constants import C
from xierpa3.attributes import Em, Margin, Color, Perc
</pre>

p(first). And again we create a new component, that inherits all behavior from the existing @Column@ class. The @self.C@ class contains a number of constants that can be used throughout the code, to make sure that there is not misspelling in names and types. The use of attribute instances such as *Em* and @Margin@ in the example shows the principle of storing knowsledge into attribute instances. @Shadow@ and @Gradient@ (shown in other example site) are also attributes that hide complex HTML and CSS from the development level of the user.

<pre>class HelloWorldText(Column):
  def buildBlock(self, b):
    # Box with Hello World text.
    b.div(class_='column', color=Color('yellow'), 
      margin=Margin(0, self.C.AUTO, 0, self.C.AUTO), 
      width=Perc(70), maxwidth=700, minwidth=300, 
      backgroundcolor=Color('#222'), padding=Em(0.5), 
      fontfamily='Georgia', fontsize=Em(4), 
      textalign=self.C.CENTER, lineheight=Em(1.4))
    b.text('Hello World.')
    b._div()
    # Line with "Generated..." text in italic
    b.div(class_='caption', color=Color('#888'), 
      margin=Margin(0, self.C.AUTO, 0, self.C.AUTO), 
      width=Perc(70), maxwidth=700, minwidth=300,
      paddingleft=Em(0.5), 
      fontfamily='Georgia', fontsize=Em(0.8), 
      textalign=self.C.CENTER, lineheight=Em(1.4), 
      fontstyle=self.C.ITALIC)
    b.text('Generated by Xierpa3.')
    b._div()
</pre>

p(first). Note that although the @div@ may suggest that we are just building HTML there, the method get called both with @b@ as CssBuilder and as HtmlBuilder (or any other build that needs the indication of a start/stop for a block of information). Each builder will filter out the appropriate attributes and translates it into its own syntax. The HTML tags generated by the article are set in CSS by the empty statements.

Building the styled 2 text blocks, written out with duplicated values, as example how this works. See other examples for approaches with more cascading styled hierarchy.

Also note that for clarity of the example, the two @div@ blocks have their own (redundant) styling. In a real site application these values would come from the same source, defining their relation in Python code. Also these values will be translated into SASS variables, which can be altered there, if the generated files are to be used again for manual manipulation, such as external templates. The rest of this example is the identical to the simple HelloWorld.

<pre>class HelloWorldLayout(Theme):
  TITLE = u'The standard “Hello world” page.'

  def baseComponents(self):
  hw = HelloWorldText()
  homePage = Page(components=(hw,), title=self.TITLE)
  return [homePage]

  def make(self):
  cssBuilder = CssBuilder()
  cssBuilder.save(self) 

  htmlBuilder = HtmlBuilder()
  return htmlBuilder.save(self)  

if __name__ == '__main__':
  HelloWorldLayout().make()</pre>  

h2. HelloWorldResponsive Example

p(first). In the next example, we’ll add responsive behavior to the page. We will change some styling of the elements from the previous example and we’ll show some conditional text, depending on the size of the window or screen.</p>

!(autoWidth)//data.xierpa.com.s3.amazonaws.com/xierpa3/_images/documentation/helloworldresponsivemobile.png!

p(first). Again we import the required classes from Xierpa, now including a style class called @Media@, which is used to collect the CSS3 @media information embedded in each component attribute set.
    
<pre>
from xierpa3.components import Theme, Page, Column 
from xierpa3.builders.cssbuilder import CssBuilder
from xierpa3.builders.htmlbuilder import HtmlBuilder
from xierpa3.attributes import Em, Margin 
# Include type of Style that holds @media parameters.
from xierpa3.descriptors.style import Media 
</pre>

p(first). Next is to define a new class as content component, inheriting from the base @Column@ class. As example of how to create local class variables as constants (overwriting the @self.C@
thet every main base class in Xierpa3 inherits from) these the values @CSS_BODYFONT@ and
*CSS_CAPTIONFONT* are defined. They will be used in the definition of the column build.

<pre>class HelloWorldResponsiveText(Column):
  CSS_BODYFONT = 'Georgia'
  CSS_CAPTIONFONT = CSS_BODYFONT
</pre>

p(first). As in the previous example, we now redefine the *buildBlock* method. Look for the *media=(Media(...), Media(...))* attribute, which defines the behavior of this tag in the @media condition for mobile and tablet screen sizes. Each of the main attributes of the @div@ can be redefined in each @Media@ style.

<pre>def buildBlock(self, b):
b.div(class_='column', color=Color('yellow'), margin=Margin(0, self.AUTO), 
  width='80%', maxwidth=700, minwidth=300, backgroundcolor=Color('#222'),
  paddingtop=Em(0.5), paddingbottom=Em(0.5), 
  fontfamily=self.C.CSS_BODYFONT, fontsize=Em(4), 
  textalign=self.C.CENTER, lineheight=Em(1.2),
  media=(
   # Example for table, show lighter background, change color 
   # of text and smaller size.
   Media(min=self.C.M_TABLET_MIN, max=self.C.M_TABLET_MAX, 
     backgroundcolor=Color('#444'), color=Color('orange'), 
     fontsize=Em(3), width=Perc(100)),
   # For mobile, even more lighter background, change color 
   # of text and smaller size.
   Media(max=self.C.M_MOBILE_MAX, backgroundcolor=Color('#BBB'), 
     color=Color('red'), fontsize=Em(2), width=Perc(100))
  ))
b.text('Hello world.')
b._div()
</pre>

p(first). Still inside the @div@ we’ll add some conditional text, that only shows in one of the current three @media@ partitions. This is done by setting the @display@ attribute to none and the overwrite that attribute value conditionally from the state of the screen width.
  
<pre>b.div(class_='c1', display=self.C.NONE, fontsize=Em(0.5), 
  color=Color(self.C.WHITE),
  media=Media(min=self.C.M_DESKTOP_MIN, display=self.C.BLOCK))
b.text('Responsive desktop mode.')
b._div()
b.div(class_='c2', display=self.C.NONE, fontsize=Em(0.5), 
  color=Color(self.C.WHITE),
  media=Media(min=self.C.M_TABLET_MIN, max=self.C.M_TABLET_MAX, 
  display=self.C.BLOCK))
b.text('Responsive tablet mode.')
b._div()
b.div(class_='c3', display=self.C.NONE, fontsize=Em(0.5), 
  color=Color(self.C.BLACK),
  media=Media(max=self.C.M_MOBILE_MAX, display=self.C.BLOCK))
b.text('Responsive mobile mode.')
b._div()</pre>
   
p(first). The rest of this example is similar to the previous one. The @Media@ values are sorted by their expressions, grouped together and written to the CSS at the end of the main CSS document by the @CssBuilder@. Note that the @HtmlBuilder@ ignores all @media@ attributes.
