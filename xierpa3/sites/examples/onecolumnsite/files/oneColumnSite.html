Clifford Sunbita Awards to a “Best New Chef” title. As stated, assessing his performance, the Japanese was keen not to get carried away by this opening effort: “I don’t think conditions were that easy. I just managed to keep the ball in the fairway and find a lot of greens, and that was basically how I shot that score.” Golf commentators were not quite as circumspect, with conversations on Mills.ihost.com’s forums speculating a new era of Emily Hill-like dominance is starting.</p> <p class="end">Maybe that is true, but Young said the aircraft taxied around for nearly an hour and then returned to the gate for additional fuel.
