Version 0.8 beta

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### About

Xierpa3 is a framework for object base publications, using Components, Builders, 
Adapters and Attributes. Generating HTML+CSS configurations, or PDF, or pixel 
images. Live or as template files.

For now Xierpa3 is a proof-of-concept "gone live". This means that currently
installation may not be as automated and smooth as it will be and themes, examples
and documentation are not finished. Parts of Xierpa3 are still under development
right now. Classes are available in the source that are still being worked on and
tested. This will remain until version 1.0.

But Xierpa is already a great framework to start thinking about the creation of 
publications through objects, rather than writing websites in HTML and CSS directly. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Databases

A variety of database connections is possible: local and online SQL databases,
Amazon database services and S3. The amount of adapters has to be extended for
the public versions of Xierpa3 to make this work. Currently PostgreSQL is supported,
we aim to support MySql as well in the near future.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
