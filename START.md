### Getting started.

Follow the installation guide lines in INSTALL.md. Then:

 * Start the terminal application
 * Goto "xierpa3/sites/examples/helloworld
 * Run "python run.py"
 
If all dependencies have been installed, the file "xierpa3/sites/examples/helloword/files/helloWorld.html"
should exist. Open it in a browser to see the result.
Try to understand the helloworld.py file and vary some of the values and see if the 
intended change is visible in the output as you expected.

Starting the server example:

 * Start the terminal application
 * Goto "xierpa3/server"
 * Run "python server.py"

If all dependencies have been installed, the following should be visible:
 
    ... Starting Xierpa 3 server
